                </div>
                <p class="wow fadeInUp animated">The annual congress of the Pacific Association of Quantity Surveyors
                    (PAQS) is a premier event that brings together professionals, academics, and industry leaders in the
                    field of quantity surveying from across the Asia and Western Pacific region. This congress serves as
                    a platform for sharing knowledge, discussing advancements, and fostering collaboration among member
                    countries.
                    <br><br>
                    Each year, the congress features a series of keynote speeches, panel discussions, and technical
                    sessions covering a wide range of topics, including construction practices, digitalization in
                    quantity surveying, and innovative project management techniques.
                    <br><br>
                    The event also provides numerous networking opportunities, allowing participants to connect with
                    peers, exchange ideas, and explore potential partnerships. The PAQS Congress is not only an
                    important opportunity for professional development but also a celebration of the achievements and
                    contributions of Quantity Surveyors in shaping the built environment.

                    Overview of Indonesia’s Quantity Surveyor</h5>
                <p class="wow fadeInUp animated">The Quantity Surveyor (QS) profession in Indonesia faces several major
                    challenges that affect their
                    effectiveness and development in the construction industry. Primarily, there is a lack of education
                    and certification, with formal education programs and specialized training for QS still limited,
                    resulting in many QS professionals not having internationally recognized certifications.
                    Additionally, differences in understanding contracts among parties involved in construction projects
                    often lead to conflicts and ambiguities in project execution. Although digitalization is a global
                    trend, the adoption of digital technology in Indonesia’s construction industry is still relatively
                    slow, necessitating QS professionals to master new technologies to improve their work efficiency and
                    accuracy. The availability of skilled and experienced QS labor also remains a challenge, especially
                    in handling large and complex projects. The lack of clear and uniform national contract standards
                    makes project management processes more complicated and prone to errors. Lastly, promoting
                    environmentally friendly practices and sustainability in construction projects remains a challenge,
                    particularly in terms of cost and the implementation of green technologies. Addressing these
                    challenges requires collaborative efforts between the government, educational institutions, and the
                    construction industry to enhance the quality and professionalism of QS in Indonesia.
                    <br><br>
                    The role of the Indonesian Association of Quantity Surveyors (IQSI) is crucial in addressing these
                    challenges. IQSI can play a significant role in enhancing QS education and certification through
                    internationally recognized training and accreditation programs, especially in PAQS (Pacific
                    Association of Quantity Surveyors) member countries
