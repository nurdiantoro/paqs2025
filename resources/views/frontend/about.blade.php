                            <p class="wow fadeInUp animated">The Pacific Association of Quantity Surveyors (PAQS) is an
                                international association
                                representing quantity surveyors in the Asia and Western Pacific region. In the early
                                1990s, several professionals and academics from various countries in the Pan Pacific
                                region began discussing the benefits of closer cooperation among members of the
                                profession in different countries. On May 20, 1994, at the invitation of the Australian
                                Institute of Quantity Surveyors (AIQS) and the New Zealand Institute of Quantity
                                Surveyors (NZIQS), several professional organizations representing Quantity Surveyors in
                                their respective countries attended a Regional Cooperation Workshop in Fremantle,
                                Western Australia. The result of the workshop was the signing of a Memorandum of
                                Understanding by the participants, initiating the process of forming a regional
                                organization for Quantity Surveyors. In May 1995, AIQS hosted the Pan Pacific Congress
                                on the Gold Coast, Queensland, and all signatories of the 1994 Memorandum of
                                Understanding were invited to attend. At this meeting, it was agreed to form PAQS and
                                establish various working groups to prepare for the official formation of this new body.
                                In May 1996, another PAQS meeting was held in Hong Kong, where the first Chairman was
                                appointed, and the draft Constitution prepared by NZIQS was officially accepted for the
                                formation of PAQS. Professor Dennis Lenard from AIQS was confirmed as the first Chairman
                                of PAQS, and AIQS accepted the role of PAQS Secretariat. PAQS was officially established
                                to promote best practices in Quantity Surveying in the region, encourage dialogue among
                                member organizations, and support relevant research for a better understanding of
                                building practices in the region.
