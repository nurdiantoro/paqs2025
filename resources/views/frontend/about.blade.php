                        The Pacific Association of Quantity Surveyors</h5>
                </div>
                <p class="wow fadeInUp animated">The Pacific Association of Quantity Surveyors (PAQS) is an
                    international association
                    representing quantity surveyors in the Asia and Western Pacific region. In the early
                    1990s, several professionals and academics from various countries in the Pan Pacific
                    region began discussing the benefits of closer cooperation among members of the
                    profession in different countries. On May 20, 1994, at the invitation of the Australian
                    Institute of Quantity Surveyors (AIQS) and the New Zealand Institute of Quantity
                    Surveyors (NZIQS), several professional organizations representing Quantity Surveyors in
                    their respective countries attended a Regional Cooperation Workshop in Fremantle,
                    Western Australia. The result of the workshop was the signing of a Memorandum of
                    Understanding by the participants, initiating the process of forming a regional
                    organization for Quantity Surveyors. In May 1995, AIQS hosted the Pan Pacific Congress
                    on the Gold Coast, Queensland, and all signatories of the 1994 Memorandum of
                    Understanding were invited to attend. At this meeting, it was agreed to form PAQS and
                    establish various working groups to prepare for the official formation of this new body.
                    In May 1996, another PAQS meeting was held in Hong Kong, where the first Chairman was
                    appointed, and the draft Constitution prepared by NZIQS was officially accepted for the
                    formation of PAQS. Professor Dennis Lenard from AIQS was confirmed as the first Chairman
                    of PAQS, and AIQS accepted the role of PAQS Secretariat. PAQS was officially established
                    to promote best practices in Quantity Surveying in the region, encourage dialogue among
                    member organizations, and support relevant research for a better understanding of
                    building practices in the region.

                    Building on the success of the 16th PAQS Congress held in Brunei in 2012, this year’s
                    gathering holds even greater significance as it continues to showcase Brunei’s ongoing
                    commitment to propelling the fields of surveying, engineering, and architecture onto the
                    global forefront. Brunei Darussalam, renowned for its rich cultural heritage, pristine
                    landscapes, and warm hospitality, provides the perfect backdrop for this esteemed event.
                    Delegates can look forward to not only engaging in thought-provoking discussions and forging
                    connections but also immersing themselves in the captivating charm of The Abode of Peace.
