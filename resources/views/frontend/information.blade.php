                <p>Climate: Being a tropical country, Indonesia does not have spring, summer, autumn, or winter, instead
                    of just the two seasons of Rainy and Dry, both of which are relative. While there is significant
                    regional variation, in most of the country (including Java and Bali) the dry season is April to
                    October, while the wet season is November to March. However, global warming has made the seasons
                    less predictable. https://www.bmkg.go.id/

                    Time Zone: Jakarta is GMT+7 (7 hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time).

                <span class="text-4xl text-warna-01 inline-block font-bold mb-4 relative">Currency & Banking</span>
                <p>• Currency
                    The official currency of Indonesia is Rupiah which is Issued and controlled by the Bank of
                    Indonesia. The currency code for Rupiahs is IDR, and the currency symbol is Rp. By law, all
                    transactions are required to be conducted in rupiah, and information on the daily exchange rate can
                    be found in newspapers or from the internet and online apps. Credit cards are widely accepted in
                    hotels, large restaurants, and large stores.

                    Indonesian banknotes come in denominations of IDR1000, IDR2000, IDR5000, IDR10000, IDR20000,
                    IDR50000, and IDR100000. Coins in circulation include IDR1000, IDR500, IDR200, IDR100, and IDR50.

                    • ATMs:
                    ATMs on the international Plus/Cirrus or Alto networks are common in all major Indonesian cities and
                    tourist destinations. Limitation withdrawal is depending on your respective home bank. Machines are
                    loaded with IDR50,000 denomination notes or IDR100,000 denomination notes, as indicated on the
                    machine; however keep in mind that the bigger notes can be harder to split, especially in rural
                    non-tourist areas. It is also best to withdraw some money from an ATM in major cities before
                    venturing onto more secluded destinations.

                    • Banks:
                    Most international credit card networks are acceptable in Indonesia’s major cities and tourist
                    hotspots like Jakarta, Bandung, Bali, Surabaya, Medan, Yogyakarta, etc.

                    Cards such as JCB (Japan Credit Bureau) is acceptable in Indonesia because it is affiliated with
                    some of Indonesia’s major well-known bank such as BNI (Bank Negara Indonesia), CIMB Niaga, Mandiri,
                    BRI (Bank Rakyat Indonesia). While American Express (Amex) is also acceptable however Amex has fewer
                    affiliated local banks in Indonesia. Bank Danamon is currently one of the local banks affiliated
                    with Amex. The most widely accepted card in all merchants in Indonesia is Visa and Mastercard.

                    There will be instances where stores may not display the symbols of the cards they accept. Be sure
                    to check with the salesperson in the store prior to using your card if your card is acceptable or
                    not.
